## Introduction

This project provides a reference implementation for running a Cloud Native Mobile and Web Application using a Microservices architecture on Bluemix Container Kubernetes cluster.  The logical architecture for this reference implementation is shown in the picture below.  

   ![Application Architecture](static/imgs/app_architecture.png?raw=true)

## Application Overview

The application is a simple store front shopping application that displays a catalog of antique computing devices, where users can search and buy products.  It has Web and Mobile interface, both the Mobile App and Web App rely on separate BFF (Backend for Frontend) services to interact with the backend data.  
(Note: the Mobile app is not currently supported at this release)

There are several components of this architecture.  

- This OmniChannel application contains both a [Native iOS Application](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/) and an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) based web application.  The diagram depicts them as a Device and Browser.  
- The iOS application uses the [IBM Mobile Analytics Service](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/mobile-analytics/) to collect device analytics for operations and business
- The Web and Mobile app invoke their own backend Microservices to fetch data, we call this component BFFs following the [Backend for Frontends](http://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) pattern.  In this Layer, front end developers usually write backend logic for their front end.  The Web BFF is implemented using the Node.js Express Framework.  The Mobile iOS BFF is implemented using Server side [Swift](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/swift).  These Microservices are packaged as Docker containers and managed by Bluemix Kubernetes cluster.  
- These BFFs invoke another layer of reusable Java Microservices.  In a real world project, this is sometimes written by a different team.  These reusable microservices are written in Java.  They run inside [IBM Bluemix Container Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/containers) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- BFFs uses [Hystrix open source library](https://github.com/Netflix/hystrix) to provide an implementation of the [Circuit Breaker Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html).  This component runs as library inside the Java Applications.  This component then forward Service Availability information to the Hystrix Dashboard.  
- The Java Microservices retrieve their data from databases.  The Catalog service retrieves items from a searchable JSON datasource using [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/). The Inventory Service using [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).  In this example, we run MySQL in a Docker Container for Development (In a production environment, it runs on our Infrastructure as a Service layer, [Bluemix Infrastructure](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=infrastructure))  The resiliency and DevOps section will explain that.

## Run the reference application in IBM Cloud

To run the sample applications you will need to configure your Bluemix environment for the Kubernetes and Microservices
runtimes.  

### Step 1: Environment Setup

#### Prerequisites

You must have a Bluemix account. The account is free and provides access to everything you need to develop, track, plan, and deploy apps. [Sign up for a trial of Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/registration). The account requires an IBMid. If you don't have an IBMid, you can create one when you register.


#### Get application source code

- Clone the base repository:  
    **`$ git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes`**

- Clone the peer repositories:  
    **`$ cd refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes && sh clonePeers.sh`**

#### Install IBM Bluemix CLI and Container Service Plugin, Kubernetes CLI and Helm

To install and test BlueCompute stack in IBM Bluemix, you need the following tools:
- [Bluemix CLI](http://clis.ng.bluemix.net/ui/home.html)
- [Bluemix Container Service plugin](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_cli_cfic.html)
- [Kubernetes cli](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/kubectl/install/) (`kubectl`)
- [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) (Helm is Kubernetes package manager)

We have developed a wrapper script to install all above tools on your Mac or Linux machine. In your root directory, execute the following command:

```
$ ./install_cli.sh
```
This script will install the CLIs for Bluemix, Container Service, Kubernetes, Helm, and jq for configuration parsing.
It will ignore what's already installed.

#### Create a New Space in Bluemix

1. Click on the Bluemix account in the top right corner of the web interface.
2. Click Create a new space.
3. Enter "cloudnative-dev" for the space name and complete the wizard.

#### Create a Bluemix API Key

1. Click on the Bluemix account in the top right corner of the web interface.
2. Click Create a new space.
3. Enter "cloudnative-dev" for the space name and complete the wizard.

```
$ bx login
$ bx iam api-key-create <api-key-name>
```

Please keep this API key as it WILL BE NEEDED in future steps.

### Step 2: Provision a Kubernetes cluster on IBM Bluemix Container service

Once you created Bluemix account and space, you will be able to provision/create a Kubernetes cluster with following instructions:

```
$ bx login
$ bx cs init
```

#### Lite Cluster

The Lite tier of Bluemix Container Service is free of charge and allows users to provision a cluster with one worker node of type `u1c.2x4` (2 core, 4GB memory, 100GB storage, 100Mbps network).  This should be sufficient to run the entire BlueCompute stack.

```
$ bx cs cluster-create --name <cluster-name>
```

#### Paid Cluster

The Paid tier of Bluemix Container Service allows users to provision a cluster in a user-selected datacenter, with configurable number of worker nodes and configurable number of worker node sizes.  The cluster is provisioned in the linked IBM Bluemix Infrastructure Account.  With a paid cluster, the Ingress Controller and Load Balancer are enabled.

First, retrieve the list of valid locations:

```
$ bx cs locations
```

Choose a location to discover the available worker node sizes:

```
$ bx cs machine-types <location>
```

(Optional) If you already have devices in Bluemix Infrastructure, you may select a specific public/private VLAN pair to place the worker nodes on.

```
$ bx cs vlans <location>
```

Make note of the `Router` of each VLAN; you must select a *private* and a *public* VLAN behind the same physical *router* in Bluemix Infrastructure.  These look like `fcr01a.dal10` for a public VLAN, and `bcr01a.dal10` for a private VLAN; ensure that the number in the router's name (e.g. `01`) matches for the public and private VLAN.

The final command looks like:

```
$ bx cs cluster-create \
    --name <cluster-name> \
    --location <location> \
    --machine-type <machine-type> \
    --private-vlan <private-vlan-id> \
    --public-vlan <public-vlan-id> \
    --workers <number-of-workers>
```

For example:

```
$ bx cs cluster-create \
    --name my-kube \
    --location dal10 \
    --machine-type b1c.4x16 \
    --private-vlan 1221455 \
    --public-vlan 1325142 \
    --workers 3
```

The entire process may take a few minutes, as the automation creates a master node in the IBM managed Bluemix Infrastructure account , then worker node(s) in your Bluemix Infrastructure account.  Monitor the cluster creation using:

```
$ bx cs clusters
$ bx cs cluster-get <cluster-name>
```

and the individual cluster node statuses:

```
$ bx cs workers <cluster-name>
```

### Step 3: Deploy reference implementation to Kubernetes Cluster

We packaged all the application components as Kubernetes [Charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts). To deploy the Bluecompute solution, please follow the instructions in the following sections.

#### Deploy BlueCompute Community Edition to Lite Cluster

We created a couple of handy scripts to deploy the Bluecompute Stack for you in the Lite Cluster. If you haven't done so, please [Create a New Bluemix Space](#create-a-new-space-in-bluemix) and [Create a Bluemix API Key](#create-a-bluemix-api-key). Then, run the following command:

```
# Supported Regions:
# ng
#  - (US South) - Default
# eu-de
#  - (Germany)

$ ./install_bluecompute_ce.sh <cluster-name> <bluemix-space-name> <bluemix-api-key> <Optional:region>
```

Once the actual install of Bluecompute takes place, it takes about 5-10 minutes to be fully deployed. So it might look like it's stuck, but it's not. Once you start to see output, look for the `Bluecompute was successfully installed!` text in green, which indicates that the deploy was successful and cleanup of jobs and installation pods will now take place. Please wait a minute or two to access the web app since some of the Microservices Pods are still initializing.

At the very end you will get a **URL** (i.e. http://169.48.138.137:31469) to access the Bluecompute Web App.    

![BlueCompute Detail](static/imgs/bluecompute_web_home.png?raw=true)  
You can reference [this link](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-bluecompute-web/tree/kube-int#validate-the-deployment) to validate the sample web application.  

Login Credentials: Once you are on the Bluecompute Web App, use the following test credentials to login:
- **Username:** user
- **Password:** passw0rd

That's it! **Bluecompute is now installed** in your Kubernetes Cluster. To see the Kubernetes dashboard, run the following command:

`$ kubectl proxy`

Then open a browser and paste the following URL to see the **Services** created by Bluecompute charts:

  http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/#/service?namespace=default

If you like to see **installation progress** as it occurs, open a browser window and paste the following URL to see the Installation Jobs. About 17 jobs will be created in sequence:

  http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/#/job?namespace=default

Be mindful that jobs come and go as new charts are getting installed.

**Notes:**

The *install_bluecompute_ce.sh* script will do the following:
1. Ask you login to Bluemix.
2. Initialize Container Plugin (bx cs init).
3. Unless already provided, it will create a Bluemix API Key
    * Not needed to deploy the reference application stack but will be needed for [DevOps and CI/CD](#devops-automation-resiliency-and-cloud-management-and-monitoring)
4. Get cluster configuration and set your terminal context to the cluster.
5. Initialize Helm.
6. Install the entire *Reference Application* Stack by installing the individual Helm charts. i.e.
    * `cd docs/charts`
    * `$ helm install chart_name --name release_name`
    * It will create all the necessary configurations before deploying any pods.
7. Cleanup Jobs and Pods used to deploy dependencies.

##### Delete Bluecompute Community Edition from Lite Cluster
To delete the Bluecompute Stack from your cluster, run the following script:

```
# Supported Regions:
# ng
#  - (US South) - Default
# eu-de
#  - (Germany)

$ ./delete_bluecompute_ce.sh <cluster-name> <bluemix-space-name> <bluemix-api-key> <Optional:region>
```

#### Deploy BlueCompute Community Edition to Local Minikube Cluster

We created a couple of handy scripts to deploy the Bluecompute Stack for you in your [Local Minikube Cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/). Please run the following command.

```
$ ./install_bluecompute_ce.sh minikube
```

Once the actual install of Bluecompute takes place, it takes about 5-10 minutes to be fully deployed. So it might look like it's stuck, but it's not. Once you start to see output, look for the `Bluecompute was successfully installed!` text in green, which indicates that the deploy was successful and cleanup of jobs and installation pods will now take place. Please wait a minute or two to access the web app since some of the Microservices Pods are still initializing.

At the very end you will get a **URL** (i.e. http://192.168.99.100:31469) to access the Bluecompute Web App.    

![BlueCompute Detail](static/imgs/bluecompute_web_home.png?raw=true)  
You can reference [this link](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-bluecompute-web/tree/kube-int#validate-the-deployment) to validate the sample web application.  

Login Credentials: Once you are on the Bluecompute Web App, use the following test credentials to login:
- **Username:** user
- **Password:** passw0rd

That's it! **Bluecompute is now installed** in your Kubernetes Cluster. To see the Kubernetes dashboard, run the following command which will open a new browser window:

`$ minikube dashboard`

Then navigate to the **Services and discovery** section to see all the **Services** created by Bluecompute charts.

If you like to see **installation progress** as it occurs, use the `minikube dashboard` command to open a new browser window, then navigate to the `Jobs` section to see Installation jobs.

Be mindful that jobs come and go as new charts are getting installed.

**Notes:**

The *install_bluecompute_ce.sh* script will do the following:

6. Install the entire *Reference Application* Stack by installing the individual Helm charts. i.e.
    * `cd docs/charts`
    * `$ helm install chart_name --name release_name`
    * It will create all the necessary configurations before deploying any pods.
7. Cleanup Jobs and Pods used to deploy dependencies.

##### Delete Bluecompute Community Edition from Local Minikube Cluster
To delete the Bluecompute Stack from your Local Minikube Cluster, run the following script:

```
$ ./delete_bluecompute_ce.sh minikube
```

#### Deploy Bluecompute to Paid Cluster

Just like in the [Deploy Bluecompute to Lite Cluster](#deploy-bluecompute-to-lite-cluster) section, we created a couple of handy scripts to deploy the Bluecompute Stack for you. If you haven't done so, please [Create a New Bluemix Space](#create-a-new-space-in-bluemix) and [Create a Bluemix API Key](#create-a-bluemix-api-key). Then, run the following command:

```
# Supported Regions:
# ng
#  - (US South) - Default
# eu-de
#  - (Germany)

$ ./install_bluecompute.sh <cluster-name> <bluemix-space-name> <bluemix-api-key> <Optional:region>
```

Once the actual install of Bluecompute takes place, it takes about 10~15 minutes to be fully deployed. So it might look like it's stuck, but it's not. Once you start to see output, look for the `Bluecompute was successfully installed!` text in green, which indicates that the deploy was successful and cleanup of jobs and installation pods will now take place.

At the very end you will get a **URL** to access the Bluecompute Web App.
That's it! **Bluecompute is now installed** in your Kubernetes Cluster. To see the Kubernetes dashboard, run the following command:

`$ kubectl proxy`

Then open a browser and paste the following URL to see the **Services** created by Bluecompute charts:

  http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/#/service?namespace=default

If you like to see **installation progress** as it occurs, open a browser window and paste the following URL to see the Installation Jobs:

  http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/#/job?namespace=default

Be mindful that jobs come and go as new charts are getting installed.

**Login Credentials:** Once you are on the Bluecompute Web App, use the following test credentials to login:
